        <li><strong>Ground Meat</strong>: This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and Herbs</strong>: These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper</li>  
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together</li>  
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe</li>  
        <li><strong>Italian Bread</strong>: Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight</li>

        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: Fry the meatballs in olive oil</li>
